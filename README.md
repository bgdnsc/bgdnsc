<summary><b>4 Hours Kubernetes Bootcamp with Nana</b></summary><br>

I can't say this any other way: Nana is badass. This close to 4 hour crash course will teach you all the base concepts that are needed to understand what is a Kubernetes cluster, what it does and how it is used accordingly. The best thing is the <b>[repo](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/youtube-tutorial-series)</b> that Nana shared, so the code from the entire video can be accessed afterwards. I oftenly use this as sample reference code, until I will probably make myself a nice list of Helm Charts. Don't know what a Helm Chart is? Watch the clip!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/X48VuDVv0do/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do) 

This was the first ever YouTube clip that got me so good, that I took the full 4 hours in a single serving. 5/5 it's a must see if you want a flash forward learning experience or even a simple refresher. Time and patience is a prerequisite for this one, but if you really want to learn something, no doubt you have to commit to it!

<summary><b>Cheat Sheet K8S Administrator Course</b></summary><br>

After you watched the previous video, it's time to share <b>[Nana's K8S Admin Course Repo](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/k8s-administrator-course)</b>. It's a gorgeous and well organized repo with shortcuts to different things. Another good refresher.

<summary><b>Teams Rooms Setup Step by Step</b></summary>

This was useful! It's a good overview for a Vendor Agnostic approach and looks only at the Microsoft Services related topic.
